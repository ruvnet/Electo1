# Agentic Election Prediction System

## Introduction

The **Agentic Election Prediction System** is designed to forecast election outcomes by leveraging an agentic approach, which involves multiple independent agents working collaboratively to process and analyze complex datasets. This system utilizes state-of-the-art Python methodologies, ensuring scalability, modularity, and precision in predictions. By integrating various data sources, optimizing parameters, and incorporating language models, the system provides both short-term and long-term election forecasts.

Imagine a world where we can model every person—past and present—and everything they interact with, in real time. Agentic systems are paving the way, combining individual functions to turn chaos into something we can understand and act on. Agentic functions and systems provide a framework that’s reshaping how we approach complex tasks and operational patterns. With agentic functions, you’re focusing on a specific task where the agent operates independently, needing little to no oversight. The more narrow the task, the better it works. Simple as that. Agentic systems, on the other hand, are about combining multiple functions or agents to work together. These systems can operate in different ways, like in a swarm or a hierarchy, or even mimicking biological or evolutionary structures. In a medical context, you can think about how a circulatory or nervous system functions, with each agent handling a specific piece of the operation. In industry, it could be how machines in a factory work together, or how the various parts of a car’s system communicate to ensure everything runs smoothly. It’s about creating a network where each agent has its role, and together they achieve a much more complex goal. Now, looking toward the future, imagine being able to model every human being alive today—and even those who’ve existed before. When you have that level of detail, it opens up possibilities that go beyond what we’ve ever been able to predict. At first, it might just be forecasting what could happen in the next few minutes or hours. But as these systems learn and improve, the accuracy grows. Over time, they’ll be able to model not just people, but all the interconnected systems those people touch—networks, data, health, everything down to the smallest detail. The potential here is enormous. These agentic systems could begin to model and predict outcomes in areas we used to think of as too chaotic to understand. By connecting everything, we can move from a world of unpredictable outcomes to one where even the most complex systems start to make sense. The key is in recognizing that these functions and systems are the building blocks for a future that can be modeled, understood, and acted upon in ways that are far more precise than anything we’ve had before. That’s the real power behind agentic systems—turning chaos into something structured and understandable, piece by piece.

## Advanced Use and Updating Instructions

### Environment Setup

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/ruvnet/Electo1.git
   cd Electo1
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
   ```sh
   poetry install
   ```

3. **Run the application**:
   ```sh
   poetry run uvicorn api.main:app --reload
   ```

### Updating the System

1. **Add new data sources**:
   - Update the `data_ingestion.py` file to include new data source URLs.
   - Ensure the new data sources are properly processed in the `data_processing.py` file.

2. **Optimize parameters**:
   - Use the `optimization_agent.py` to perform hyperparameter tuning and update the model parameters.

3. **Retrain the model**:
   - Run the `train_model` function in the `prediction_agent.py` file to retrain the model with new data.

4. **Update API endpoints**:
   - Modify the `main.py` and `routers/` files to add or update API endpoints as needed.

5. **Run tests**:
   - Ensure all tests in the `tests/` directory pass before deploying updates.
   ```sh
   poetry run pytest
   ```

6. **Deploy the updated system**:
   - Use containerization (e.g., Docker) and orchestration (e.g., Kubernetes) to deploy the updated system to production environments.
